# Design System

The Design System component guides a user through the seven sections of the GamiDoc design flow. Routes exist in two mirrored scopes:

- `/api/v1/sessions/{sessionId}/design/...` for the anonymous flow, no auth, state stored in Redis with the session TTL
- `/api/v1/projects/{projectId}/design/...` for authenticated users, Bearer auth plus ownership check, state stored in Postgres

Unless stated otherwise, every route in both scopes shares the guard errors below in addition to its own:

| Scope | Guard errors |
| --- | --- |
| Sessions | `400 INVALID_SESSION_ID`, `404 SESSION_NOT_FOUND`, `500 INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR` |
| Projects | `401 UNAUTHORIZED`, `400 INVALID_PROJECT_ID`, `404 PROJECT_NOT_FOUND`, `403 FORBIDDEN`, `500 INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR` |

## Flow Model

- Section 1 (Context) is always first. After it, the user picks path `A` (1,2,3,4,5,6,7) or `B` (1,4,5,2,3,6,7).
- On the first pass, sections unlock in path order; a visited section can be re-saved at any time. Sections can also be skipped.
- After a full first pass, navigation is free and the dashboard unlocks (it needs at least one filled section).
- The AI provider is selected with `AI_PROVIDER` (`noop` default, or `openai-compatible` with `AI_BASE_URL`, `AI_API_KEY`, `AI_MODEL`).

## `GET .../design`

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Success | `200` design status object |
| Notes | Returns the full design state: spark, path, cursor, first-pass flag, sections, session-generated reports |

## `PUT .../design/spark`

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Body | `{ "spark": "..." }` |
| Success | `200` `{ "designStatus", "prefillApplied", "prefillFailed" }` |
| Errors | `400 INVALID_INPUT` |
| Notes | A non-empty spark asks the AI provider to prefill empty sections; user-entered content is never overwritten. `prefillFailed` is `true` when the provider errored, the spark itself is still saved |

## `GET .../design/branch`

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Success | `200` `{ "recommendedPath": "A"\|"B", "basis": "spark"\|"default" }` |
| Errors | `502 AI_PROVIDER_ERROR` |
| Notes | Without a spark the default recommendation is path `A` |

## `POST .../design/path`

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Body | `{ "path": "A"\|"B" }` |
| Success | `200` design status object |
| Errors | `400 INVALID_INPUT`, `400 INVALID_PATH`, `400 SECTION_LOCKED`, `409 PATH_ALREADY_CHOSEN` |
| Notes | Allowed only right after the Context section on the first pass |

## `PUT .../design/section/{sectionNumber}`

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Body | `{ "content": {...}, "complete": true\|false, "skip": true\|false }` |
| Success | `200` `{ "sectionNumber", "section", "designStatus" }` |
| Errors | `400 INVALID_INPUT`, `400 INVALID_SECTION_NUMBER`, `400 INVALID_SECTION_DATA`, `400 SECTION_LOCKED`, `400 PATH_NOT_CHOSEN` |
| Notes | `content` is free-form JSON, field order is preserved in reports. `complete` is optional; omitting it keeps the current completion flag. `skip: true` marks the section visited without content |

## `GET .../design/dashboard`

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Success | `200` `{ "overallPercent", "sections": [{ "number", "name", "description", "status", "percent" }] }` |
| Errors | `403 DASHBOARD_LOCKED` |
| Notes | Section status is `empty`, `in_progress` (visited or partial), or `complete` |

## `POST .../design/generate-pdf`

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Body | none |
| Success | `200` `{ "standard": { "id", "version", "url", "createdAt" }, "enhanced": {...} }` |
| Errors | `403 DASHBOARD_LOCKED`, `502 AI_PROVIDER_ERROR` |
| Notes | One trigger produces both report versions: `standard` mirrors the form content in order, `enhanced` is AI-consolidated prose with cross-section deduplication. Project reports are recorded in `design_reports`; session reports are kept in the session design state |

## `GET .../design/faq/{sectionNumber}`

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Success | `200` `{ "sectionNumber", "faq": [{ "question", "answer" }] }` |
| Errors | `400 INVALID_SECTION_NUMBER` |

## `POST .../design/ai/rewrite`

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Body | `{ "text": "..." }` |
| Success | `200` `{ "text", "previousText" }` |
| Errors | `400 INVALID_INPUT`, `400 EMPTY_TEXT`, `502 AI_PROVIDER_ERROR` |

## `POST .../design/ai/chat`

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Body | `{ "sectionNumber": 1..7, "message": "..." }` |
| Success | `200` `{ "sectionNumber", "reply", "faq" }` |
| Errors | `400 INVALID_INPUT`, `400 INVALID_SECTION_NUMBER`, `502 AI_PROVIDER_ERROR` |

## `GET /api/v1/projects/{projectId}/design/reports`

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Success | `200` `{ "reports": [...], "total" }` |
| Notes | Project scope only; newest first |

## `POST /api/v1/projects/{projectId}/design/import-session`

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Body | `{ "sessionId": "..." }` |
| Success | `200` imported design status object |
| Errors | `400 INVALID_INPUT`, `404 SESSION_NOT_FOUND`, `409 SESSION_DESIGN_EMPTY`, `409 DESIGN_NOT_EMPTY` |
| Notes | Project scope only. Refuses to import an empty session state and refuses to overwrite existing project design content. Session-generated reports are migrated into `design_reports` |

## Activity Events

Design routes are tracked by the activity middleware: `design_section_saved`, `design_path_chosen`, `design_pdf_generated`, `design_imported`; everything else falls back to `api_request`.
